Gomory's cut implementation in C language
=========================================

Implementation of [Gomory's cut algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method#Gomory.27s_cut)
to solve the [Cutting stock problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem)

From wikipedia:

    It arises from many applications in industry. 
    Imagine that you work in a paper mill and you have a number of rolls of paper of 
    fixed width waiting to be cut, yet different customers want different numbers of 
    rolls of various-sized widths. How are you going to cut the rolls so that you 
    minimize the waste (amount of left-overs)?


Written and optimised in C language.
